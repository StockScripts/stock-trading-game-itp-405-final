# Final ITP 405 Project - Stock Trading Game

### For more details about the project, launch it here and navigate to about page:
http://laravel-final.herokuapp.com/

### Note:
Because I developed two separate apps in the same repo, the deployed apps are in separate repos here:

#### Laravel:
https://github.com/brighton1101/itp-405-final-heroku-laravel

#### Node:
https://github.com/brighton1101/itp-405-final-node

These should mirror what is currently in this repo, with a few modifications for Heroku.

### Youtube Demo:

- Note that there are a lot of moving parts and I had to move through everything quickfully

##### Some parts I think you should check out:
- All the React stuff in `php/resources/js`
- API calls in `node/stock_api_calls/api_calls.js`
- `TransactionsController`, `UserObserver`, etc.
